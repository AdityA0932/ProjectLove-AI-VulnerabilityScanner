# ProjectLove-AI-VulnerabilityScanner

ProjectLove is an advanced AI-powered vulnerability scanner designed to detect potential security vulnerabilities in web applications. Leveraging machine learning techniques, it aims to identify various types of vulnerabilities, including those listed in the OWASP Top 10.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Detection**: Utilizes a BERT-based model for intelligent vulnerability detection.
- **Real-time Traffic Monitoring**: Continuously analyzes incoming traffic for potential threats.
- **Multi-Target Support**: Capable of monitoring multiple URLs simultaneously.
- **Adaptive Learning**: Incorporates user feedback to improve detection accuracy over time.
- **Comprehensive Vulnerability Coverage**: Detects a wide range of vulnerabilities, including SQL Injection, XSS, and more.
- **Interactive CLI**: User-friendly command-line interface for easy operation.
